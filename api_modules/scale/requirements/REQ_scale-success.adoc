^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/coverage-scaling/success*
^|A |The `scale-size=AxisName(count)`, `scale-factor=factor` and `scale-axes=AxisName(factor)` parameters SHALL be supported for the coverage and range set resources.
^|B |When `scale-size` is used, the returned coverage SHALL contain exactly the specified number of sample values along each axis which is specified, and the original number of sample values for unspecified axes.
^|C |When `scale-factor` is used, for each axis, the returned coverage SHALL contain the number of original sampled values, divided by _factor_.
^|D |When `scale-axes` is used, for each axis specified, the returned coverage SHALL contain the number of original sampled values, divided by the _factor_ specified for that axis, and the original number of sample values for unspecified axes.
^|E |When `scale-size` is used together with subsetting, the requested number of samples SHALL be mapped to the subset dimensions specified, even if those dimensions fall partially outside the extent of the coverage.
