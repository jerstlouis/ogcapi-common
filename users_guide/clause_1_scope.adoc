== Scope

The OGC API — Common standard is a multi-part standard that specifies reusable building-blocks that can be used in the construction of OGC API Standards. The purpose of the OGC API — Common standard is to define those fundamental building blocks and requirements which are applicable to all, if not most, OGC Web API standards.

The *OGC API — Common — Users Guide* presents information useful to developers or users of implementations of OGC API — Common. The Users Guide focuses on OGC API — Common but is applicable to other OGC API Standards, specifically those OGC API Standards that implement requirements classes from OGC API — Common. The Users Guide discusses the architecture adopted by OGC API - Common, use of identifiers, link relations, OGC API Collections, and the OpenAPI specification.
