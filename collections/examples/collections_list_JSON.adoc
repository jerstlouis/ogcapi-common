[collection-list-example-1]

This example response listing available collections in JSON is for a dataset with a single "buildings" feature collection.

There is a link to the resource listing collections itself (link relation type: `self`).

Representations of this resource in other formats are referenced (link relation type: `alternate`).

An additional link is to the logical schema of the collection (link relation type: `[ogc-rel:schema]`).
