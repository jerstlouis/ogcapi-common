== Requirements Class "Sortable Collections"
:sectnums:

include::requirements/requirements_class_sorting.adoc[]

This Requirements Class describes query parameters that can be used to retrieve a list of collections exposed through an OGC Web API sorted in a specific order.

[[sorting-overview]]
=== Overview

This "Sortable Collections" defines the <<sorting-sortby-parameter,sortby>> query parameter which can be used with the `/collections` endpoint (described in the <<rc-collections-section,Collections>> Requirements Class)
to retrieve a list of collections returned by a GET request in a specific order.

If implementing https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core] "Landing Page", these supported query parameters need to be described in the API definition as described in that part.

=== OGC API - Records compliance

This "Sortable Collections" requirement class is consistent with the requirements of https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html#clause-local-resources-catalog_filtering[OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core "Local Resources Catalog - Filtering" (Deployment)].
An implementation may gain additional interoperability by conforming to that requirement class from OGC API - Records as well.
In this case, in addition to the five OGC API - Records requirement classes mentioned in the <<collections-api-records,Collections requirements class>>, the implementation should verify and declare conformance with these additional two conformance classes defined in Records corresponding to the following URIs:
