You should edit the `qea` file in this UML folder using Enterprise Architect v16.1 or above.

Once edited, then export the XMI file to the xmi-full folder and the images to the xmi-images folder.

Ensure that the XML Type is set to “UML 2.4.1 (XMI 2.4.2)” as explained at https://docs.ogc.org/dp/23-040.html#_17b255c6-0158-4c94-94b6-393bf92c17e2[here].
