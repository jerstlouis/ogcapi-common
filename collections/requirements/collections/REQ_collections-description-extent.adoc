identifier:: /req/collections/description-extent
part:: For each spatial collection resource, the `extent` property, if provided, SHALL define boundaries that encompass the spatial and temporal extent of the data in this collection.
The temporal extent may use `null` values to indicate a half-bounded or unbounded time interval. +
If the data contains spatial or temporal information defined in multiple properties, it is up to implementation how this extent is derived from those properties.
part:: For the spatial dimension, the `storageCrsBbox` in the `spatial` property describes that interval rather than an `interval` property.
If no `storageCrs` and `storageCrsBbox` are present, the `bbox` of the `spatial` property describes that interval in the default [OGC:CRS84].
