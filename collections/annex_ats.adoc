== Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

=== Introduction

OGC Web APIs are not a Web Services in the traditional sense. Rather, they define the behavior and content of a set of Resources exposed through a Web Application Programing Interface (Web API). Therefore, an API may expose resources in addition to those defined by the standard. A test engine must be able to traverse the API, identify and validate test points, and ignore resource paths which are not to be tested.

The Conformance Classes addressed by this Abstract Test Suite are the:

* <<ats_collections,Collections Conformance Class>>
* <<ats_simple-query,Simple Query Conformance Class>>
* <<ats_html,HTML Conformance Class>>
* <<ats_json,JSON Conformance Class>>
