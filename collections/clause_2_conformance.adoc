== Conformance

Conformance with this Standard shall be checked using the tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document.

The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to claim conformance are specified in the <<citepp,OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures>> and the
https://www.ogc.org/compliance/[OGC Compliance Testing] web site.

The Standardization Target for this Standard is Web APIs.

OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data defines API modules intended for re-use by other OGC Web API standards. For the purpose of conformance, the applicable API modules are identified by <<ctc-definition,Conformance Classes>>.

Typically, the OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data will only be implemented through reference to these Conformance Classes by other standards.

OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data identifies four <<ctc-definition,conformance classes>>. Each conformance class is defined by one <<requirements-class-definition,requirements class>>.

The tests in Annex A are organized by Requirements Class. Therefore, an implementation of the _Collections_ conformance class must pass all tests specified in Annex A for the _Collections_ requirements class.

The requirements classes defined in Part 2: Geospatial Data are:

* <<rc-collections-section,Collections>>
* <<rc-umd-collection-section,Uniform Multi-Dimension Collection>>
* <<rc-html-section,HTML>>
* <<rc-json-section,JSON>>

The <<rc-collections-section,Collections Requirements Class>> defines a common means to list and describe <<collection-definition,collections>> of <<spatial-resource-definition,spatial resources>>,
but does not mandate a specific encoding or format for representing resources.

The <<rc-umd-collection-section,Uniform Multi-Dimension Collection Requirements Class>> defines a consistent way to describe the domain of multidimensional collections of data,
including additional dimensions beyond space and time, as well as regular and irregular grids.

The <<rc-html-section,_HTML_>> and <<rc-json-section,_JSON_>> requirements classes specify representations for these resources in commonly used encodings for spatial data on the web.

Common API-2: GeoData builds on API modules defined in the `OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core` (<<OGC19-072,API-Core>>) Standard.

Each <<requirements-class-definition,requirements class>> in the Common API-2: GeoData Standard identifies any API-Core <<ctc-definition,Conformance Classes>> upon which it depends.

Proof of conformance with a <<ctc-definition,Conformance Class>> includes demonstration of conformance with all dependencies of that <<ctc-definition,Conformance Class>>.

The abstract tests in <<annex-ats,Annex A>> have been organized to facilitate validation of these dependencies.

These tests have been organized by <<requirements-class-definition,requirements class>>.

A referencing standard only has to require conformance with a <<ctc-definition,Conformance Class>> and all of the requirements and relevant tests are identified.

In addition, each <<ctc-definition,conformance class>> includes one or more test.

This Standard specifies the requirements necessary to discover and describe collections of data, but does not specify how to access that data.
Other OGC API Standards define <<data-access-mechanism-definition, data access mechanisms>> which can be combined with the requirements classes defined in this Standard.
