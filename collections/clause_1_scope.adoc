== Scope

Spatial data is rarely considered as a single entity.
Since <<feature-collection-definition,Feature Collections>>, <<coverage-definition,Coverages>>, <<dataset-definition,Data Sets>>
are all aggregations of <<spatial-thing-definition,Spatial>> or <<temporal-thing-definition,Temporal>> ResourcesÂ¸
an OGC Web API would also expose its holdings as aggregates of spatial resources called _collections_.

A single API may provide access to a large number of collections.
The purpose of the OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data (Common API-2: GeoData) Standard is to specify
Web resources for listing and describing available collections.

Common API-2: GeoData does not specify the nature of the geospatial data contained in a collection.
Rather, this Standard specifies a basic capability which should be applicable to any geospatial resource type or access mechanisms.
Additional OGC Web API Standards extend this foundation to define specific data access mechanisms.
