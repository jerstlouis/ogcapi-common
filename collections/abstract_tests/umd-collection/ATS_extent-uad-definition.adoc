FOR each additional dimension beyond `spatial` and `temporal`:

. Validate that the dimension property includes an `interval` property,
. Validate that the dimension property includes includes a `trs`, `vrs` or `definition`,
. Validate that the dimension property includes a `unit` if the `trs`, `vrs` or `definition` does not imply a specific unit.

NOTE: The first two aspects of this validation can be performed by swapping the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/blob/master/collections/openapi/schemas/common-geodata/extent.yaml[extent.yaml] schema
included by https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/blob/master/collections/openapi/schemas/common-geodata/collectionDesc.yaml[collectionDesc.yaml] by a version
where the `- type: object` within the `anyOf` has been removed, as per the comment saying _To validate against the Uniform Additional Dimensions requirements class, remove or comment out the following line_.
