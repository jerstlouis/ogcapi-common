IF the `extent` property is present, THEN:

. Verify that for `spatial` properties having more than a single bounding box, all bounding boxes are included within the first bounding box.
. Verify that for `temporal` properties (as well as for additional properties if conforming to Uniform Multi-dimension Collection) having more than a single interval, all intervals are within the first interval.
NOTE: A temporal extent of `null` indicates a half-bounded or unbounded time interval.
