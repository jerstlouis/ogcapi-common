  attribution:
    type: string
    title: Attribution for the collection
    description: |-
     Attribution for the collection that can contain markup text whose format may be indicated in the `attributionMediaType` property. That format can be either plain text (`text/plain`), HTML (`text/html`) or https://commonmark.org/[CommonMark] (`text/markdown`).
     If the 'attributionMediaType' indicates something other than `text/plain`, the `attribution` element string should be interpreted by a markup parser selected based on that media type to be presented to the user
     (e.g., `text/markdown` will be parsed by a library supporting CommonMark). By allowing markup, the attribution string can import images (e.g., organization logos) and format the text (e.g., the name of the organization in italics).
