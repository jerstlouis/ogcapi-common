     title: Interval of the extent of this dimension
     description: |-
       One or more intervals that describe the extent for this dimension of the dataset.
       The value `null` is supported and indicates an unbounded or half-bounded interval.
       The first interval describes the overall extent of the data for this dimension.
       All subsequent intervals describe more precise intervals, e.g., to identify clusters of data.
       Clients only interested in the overall extent will only need
       to access the first item (a pair of lower and upper bound values).

     items:
       description: |-
         Lower and upper bound values of the interval. The values
         are in the coordinate reference system specified in `crs`, `trs` or `vrs`.
