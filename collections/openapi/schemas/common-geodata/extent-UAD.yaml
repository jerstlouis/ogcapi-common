title: Extent conforming to Uniform Additional Dimensions Schema
description: |-
   The extent of the data in the collection.
   This extent schema requires that if any dimension beyond spatial and temporal are specified, they conform to the Uniform Additional Dimensions schema.
   In addition to the spatial and temporal extents defined in the "Collections" requirements class of OGC API - Common - Part 2,
   the "Uniform Additional Dimensions" requirements class specifies a generic schema for describing any additional dimension, such as thermal or pressure ranges.
