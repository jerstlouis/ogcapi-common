==== HTTP status codes

This API standard does not impose any restrictions on which features of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols may be used. API clients should be prepared to handle any legal HTTP or HTTPS status code.

The *Status Codes* listed in <<status_codes>> are of particular relevance to implementors of this standard. Status codes 200, 400, and 404 are called out in API requirements. Therefore, support for these status codes is mandatory for all compliant implementations. The remainder of the status codes in <<status_codes>> are not mandatory, but are important for the implementation of a well functioning API. Support for these status codes is strongly encouraged for both client and server implementations.

|Status code |Description
|`200` |A successful request.
|`304` |An <<web_caching,entity tag was provided in the request>> and the resource has not been changed since the previous request.
|`400` |The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
|`401` |The request requires user authentication. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
|`403` |The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfil it. While status code `401` indicates missing or bad authentication, status code `403` indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
|`404` |The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
|`405` |The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
|`406` |Content negotiation failed. For example, the `Accept` header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
|`500` |An internal error occurred in the server.

==== Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

As discussed in Chapter 9 of the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web (SDW) <<SDWBP,Best Practices document>>, how to express and share the location of resources in a consistent way is one of the most fundamental aspects of publishing geographic data. Therefore, clearly stating the CRS rules for the coordinates is very important.

For the reasons discussed in the SDW Best Practice, OGC APIs use WGS84 longitude and latitude as the default CRS.

include::requirements/core/REQ_crs84.adoc[]

The implementations of Common API-2: GeoData are not required to support publishing geometries in CRS other than http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84. Common API-2: GeoData also does not specify a capability to request geometries in a different CRS than the native one of the published resource. Such a capability will be specified in other OGC API standards.
