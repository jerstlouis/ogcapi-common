== Scope

The OGC API - Common suite of standards provides a set of modular API standards which can be used to build resource and mission-specific Web API standards. The OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data Standard (API-GeoData) is one of those modules.

Geospatial resources are typically packaged into sets or collections of related resources. A single API may host a large number of collections. This API-Geodata standard provides a means of organizing these collections and defines operations for discovering and selecting individual collections.

API-GeoData does not specify the nature of the geospatial data that make up a collection. Rather, it provides a basic capability which should be applicable to any geospatial resource type. Additional OGC Web API standards extend this foundation to define resource-specific capabilities.
