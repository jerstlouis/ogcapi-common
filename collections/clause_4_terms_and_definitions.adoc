== Terms and Definitions

[[collection-definition]]
=== *collection*
(in the context of OGC APIs) A set of spatiotemporal data that may be available through one or more <<data-access-mechanism-definition,access mechanisms>> defined by OGC API standard(s)

[[coverage-definition]]
=== *coverage*

// NOTE: That definition was from the older Topic 6, and the newer definition from Topic 6
// says "range type" rather than "range" which seems incorrect
// include::./glossaries/iso_tc211/2573_coverage.adoc[]
function which returns values from its range for any direct position within its domain

[[data-access-mechanism-definition]]
=== *data access mechanism*
(in the context of OGC APIs) mechanism defined by an OGC API Standard to access spatiotemporal data from a <<collection-definition,collection>>

Such mechanism is based on Web resources which are sub-resources of that collection. The access mechanism could be as simple as the definition of a single sub-resource URL template.
The access mechanism may allow Web clients to access parts and/or the totality of the data available from the collection.

[[dataset-definition]]
=== *dataset*
collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations (<<DCAT,DCAT>>)

[[distribution-definition]]
=== *distribution*
specific representation of a <<dataset-definition,dataset>> +
A <<dataset-definition,dataset>> might be available in multiple serializations that may differ in various ways, including natural language, media-type or format, schematic organization, temporal and spatial resolution, level of detail or profiles (which might specify any or all of the above). (<<DCAT,DCAT>>) +
 +
EXAMPLE: a downloadable file, an RSS feed or an API.

[[extent-definition]]
=== *extent*
area covered by something. Within this document, "extent" refers to spatial extent +
The size or shape that may be expressed using coordinates. (<<SDWBP,W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice>>)

[[feature-definition]]
=== *feature*

include::./glossaries/iso_tc211/168_feature.adoc[]

[[feature-collection-definition]]
=== *feature collection*

include::./glossaries/iso_tc211/2500_feature_collection.adoc[]

[[geometry-definition]]
=== *geometry*
ordered set of _n_-dimensional points in a given coordinate reference system (<<SDWBP,W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice>>)

[[ogc-webapi-definition]]
=== *OGC Web API*
<<webapi-definition,Web API>> that implements one or more <<ctc-definition,Conformance Classes>> from an OGC API Standard

[[resource-definition]]
=== *resource*
entity that might be identified (<<iso15836-2,Dublin Core Metadata Initiative - DCMI Metadata Terms>>) +

NOTE: The term "resource", when used in the context of an OGC Web API standard, should be understood to mean a <<web-resource-definition,Web Resource>> unless otherwise indicated.

[[resource-type-definition]]
=== *resource type*
definition of a type of <<resource-definition,resource>> +
Resource types are re-usable components which are independent of where the resource resides in the API. +

NOTE: Resource types are re-usable components that are independent of where the resource resides in the API."

[[spatial-resource-definition]]
=== *spatial resource*
<<resource-definition,resource>> which represents or includes spatial data +
A <<spatial-thing-definition,Spatial Thing>>.

[[spatial-thing-definition]]
=== *spatial thing*
anything with spatial extent, (i.e. size, shape, or position) and is a combination of the real-world phenomenon and its abstraction (<<SDWBP,W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice>>)

[[temporal-cs-definition]]
=== *temporal coordinate system*

include::./glossaries/iso_tc211/446_temporal_coordinate_system.adoc[]

[[temporal-position-definition]]
=== *temporal position*

include::./glossaries/iso_tc211/449_temporal_position.adoc[]


[[trs-definition]]
=== *temporal reference system*

include::./glossaries/iso_tc211/450_temporal_reference_system.adoc[]

[[temporal-resource-definition]]
=== *temporal resource*
<<resource-definition,resource>> which represents or includes time and date +
A <<temporal-thing-definition,Temporal Thing>>.

[[temporal-thing-definition]]
=== *temporal thing*
anything with temporal extent, i.e. duration +
Examples are: The taking of a photograph, a scheduled meeting, or a GPS time-stamped track-point. (https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/[W3C Basic Geo])

[[webapi-definition]]
=== *Web API*
API using an architectural style that is founded on the technologies of the Web (<<DWBP,W3C Data on the Web Best Practices>>)

[[web-resource-definition]]
=== *web resource*
<<resource-definition,resource>> that is identified by a URI

NOTE: For example, a web resource is any file or asset, such as text, images, HTML, XML, or JavaScript, that can be accessed over the web using a unique URL/URI
