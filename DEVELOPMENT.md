## Using the standard

OGC API-Common provides the basic structure and building blocks for OGC APIs. It is not itself a useful API. Other OGC API standards extend this foundation to support the resources within their defined scope.  API-Common, in turn, assures that OGC APIs have a common look and feel.  API-Common also defined a set of API Modules which provide re-usable capabilities for OGC APIs. 
The standard and various developer resources are available on the [OGC API website](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common/).

## Participation

The OGC API - Common Standard is developed and maintained by the OWS Common 1.2 Standards Working Group (SWG). OGC members can join the SWG by accepting the Observer Agreement [at](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25506).

The OGC strives to make API standards development as open as possible. For that reason, the [GitHub](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common) repository for this standard is a public repository. Participation by non-OGC members is welcome.

The contributor understands that any contributions, if accepted by 
the OGC Membership, shall be incorporated into OGC standards documents and that all 
copyright and intellectual property shall be vested to the OGC.
