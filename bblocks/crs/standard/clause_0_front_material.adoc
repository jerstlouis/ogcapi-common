[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC Web Feature Service 3.0, Part 1 - Core standard defines the behaviour 
of a server that can present geometry valued feature properties in a single
coordinate reference system, WGS84 (longitude, latitude).  Part 1 includes
extension points for supporting multiple coordinate reference systems but does
not describe the behaviour of a server for this case.

This part of the WFS standard defines the behaviour of a server that supports
multiple coordinate reference systems.  It describes mechanisms for:

* discovering the list of supported coorindate reference systems
* requesting that geometry valued feature properties be presented in one
  of these supported coordinate reference systems
* explicitly declaring the coordinates reference system begin used, and
  optionally the coordinate axis order, in a response document

It should be clarified that this standard only deals with single coordinate
reference system references that can be specified using an identifier (e.g.
a URL). Compound coordinate reference system references or explicitly specified
coordinate reference systems (i.e. those specified explicitly in a request
using some notation like WKT or GML) are not covered in this standard.

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
