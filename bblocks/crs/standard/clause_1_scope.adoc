== Scope

This International Standard specifies the behaviour of a server that supports
multiple coordinate reference systems.

This International Standard specifies how, for each offered feature collection,
a server advertises the list of supported coordinate reference systems.

This International Standard specifies how the coordinates of geometry valued
feature properties can be accessed in one of the supported coordinate
reference systems.

This International Standard specifies how features can be accesses from the
server using a bounding box specified in one of the supported coordinate 
reference systems.

This International Standard specifies how a server can declare the coordinate
reference system, and optionally, the axis order of coordinates retrieved from 
from a server.
