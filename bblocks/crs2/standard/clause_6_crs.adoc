== Requirements Class Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference

[[crs-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_crs.adoc[]

The <<OAComm-1,OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core>> standard defines support for only two coordinate reference systems:

* WGS 84 longitude/latitude
* WGS 84 longitude/latitude plus ellipsoidal height

This extensions defines the behaviour of a server that supports additional coordinate reference systems.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/295[Open issue 295] +
This draft is specific to Features and extends the resources 'feature collection', 'features' and 'feature'. However, in general the approach specified in this draft should also be applicable to other resource types and feedback would be welcome how such reuse could be improved.

[[crs-discovery]]
=== Discovery

==== CRS identifier list

include::requirements/crs/REQ_fc-md-crs-list.adoc[]

The default CRS -- that is the CRS used unless something else is explicitly requested -- is defined in <<OAComm-1,OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core>> as:

* http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 (for coordinates without height)
* http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h (for coordinates with height)

The list of supported CRS identifiers in the collection metadata may include these defaults but this is not a requirement.

NOTE: Where do we put the CRS identifiers if we are no longer tied to API-Features?

==== Storage CRS

The storage CRS for a spatial resource collection is the CRS identifier that may be used to retrieve resources from that collection without the need to apply a CRS transformation.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/264[Open issue 264] +
To align with the new version of ISO 19111 / OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2, it should also be possible to state the link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/as/18-005r4/18-005r4.html#68[coordinate epoch] of the data (if known), if the storage CRS is a dynamic CRS. In this case, it should also be recommended to use a specific realization, not a CRS using a datum ensemble.

include::requirements/crs/REQ_fc-md-storageCrs.adoc[]

include::requirements/crs/REQ_fc-md-storageCrs-valid-value.adoc[]

The following schema fragment extends the collection metadata to add the `storageCRS` property.

==== Global list of CRS identifiers

To prevent unnecessary duplication of lists of supported CRS identifiers in the collection metadata, a global list of supported CRS identifiers may be provided as part of the collections metadata.

This global list of CRS identifiers is not automatically inherited by each collection offered by the service.  Rather the global list of CRS identifiers must be explicitly referenced in the collection metadata using a JSON Pointer (RFC 6901).

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/274[Open issue 274] +
We are looking for feedback what option would be best to encode a reference to the global list (a JSON Pointer, a JSON Reference, or something else). What works best for clients parsing the response?

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/315[Open issue 315] +
For large lists of supported CRS, the global CRS list could be placed in its own resource.

include::requirements/crs/REQ_fc-md-crs-list-global.adoc[]

The following schema fragment extends the collections metadata to add the `crs` property which contains the global list of CRS identifiers.

=================

The `bonn_buildings` collection is offered in all the coordinate reference systems specified in the global list plus five other coordinate reference systems.

The `tor_buildings` collection is offered in the coordinate reference systems specified in the global list.

The `dc_buildings` collection, not having a crs property, is only offered in the default CRS (i.e. WGS84 longitude, latitude).

==== Parameter bbox-crs

The `bbox-crs` parameter may be used to assert the CRS used for the coordinate values of the `bbox` parameter.

There is ongoing work to add negotiation of the CRS to the content negotiation process. However, this is still draft and not widely supported. For this reason, such a capability is considered right now only for a future revision.

==== Output format considerations

OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core defines three conformance classes related to the output formats:

- GML
- GeoJSON
- HTML

GML has full CRS support and no further requirements are imposed by this standard.

GeoJSON normatively supports WGS84 (lon,lat) but the "prior arrangement" provision allows other coordinate systems to be used.

include::requirements/crs/REQ_geojson.adoc[]

NOTE: Need to do more work on HTML!

HTML only supports WGS84 based on schema.org dependency; not sure if this is an issue but schema.org annotations seem to require WGS84 (lat,lon) yet WFS core requires lon,lat by default.

==== Coordinate system and axis order

Because of the inconsistent provision of coordinate reference system metadata in geospatial encodings and the continued confusion caused by the axis order of coordinates, this standard defines a mechanism for a server to clearly and unambiguously assert the coordinate reference system and axis order being used in a response document independent of the requested output format.

The draft content negotiation by CRS specifies a `Content-Crs` header that could be used instead of a custom `OGC-CRS` header. The `Content-Crs` header just states the CRS, but has no option to state the axis order. +
It is a related general question, if a capability to state the axis order would be helpful or not.

The following example illustrates the use of the `OGC-CRS` header.
