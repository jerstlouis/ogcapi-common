^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/crs/crs-format-model* +
2+|Servers that implement this extension should be able to recognize and generate CRS identifiers with the following format model:

http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/{authority}/{version}/{code}

In this format model, the token {authority} is a placeholder for a code the
designates to authority responsible for the definition of this CRS.  Typical
values include "EPSG" and "OGC".

The token {version} is a placeholder for the specific version of the coordinate
reference system definition or `0` for the latest version or if the version
is unknown.

The token {code} is a placeholder for the authority's code for the CRS.
