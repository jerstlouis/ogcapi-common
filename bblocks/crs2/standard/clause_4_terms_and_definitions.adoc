== Terms and Definitions
This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=38867[OGC Web Services Common] (OGC 06-121r9), which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

This document also uses the terms defined in Clause 5 of https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=tbd[OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core].

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

=== coordinate
one of a sequence of numbers designating the position of a point [ISO 19111:2019, definition 3.1.5]

NOTE: In a spatial coordinate reference system, the coordinate numbers are qualified by units.

=== coordinate reference system (CRS)
coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum [ISO 19111:2019, definition 3.1.9]

=== coordinate system
set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points [ISO 19111:2019, definition 3.1.11]

=== feature
abstraction of real world phenomena [ISO 19101-1:2014]

NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with the term 'feature', the explanations in
the <<SDWBP,W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice document>> may help,
in particular the section on
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#spatial-things-features-and-geometry[Spatial Things, Features and Geometry].

[[_feature_collection]]
=== feature collection; collection
a set of *features* from a *dataset*

NOTE: In this specification, 'collection' is used as a synonym for 'feature
collection'. This is done to make, for example, URI path expressions shorter
and easier to understand for those that are not geo-experts.

=== spatial feature collection; spatial collection
a feature collection that includes one or more geometry-valued properties
