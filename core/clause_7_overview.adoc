== Overview

The OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core Standard defines common requirements and recommendations which are applicable to all OGC Web API Standards.

[[evolution-introduction]]
=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards implement a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using XML for payloads. This was the state-of-the-art when OGC Web Services (OWS) were originally designed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, technology has evolved. New Resource-Oriented APIs provide an alternative to the Service-Oriented Approach. New OGC Web API standards are under development to provide API alternatives to the OWS standards.

The OGC API - Common Standard specifies common modules for defining OGC Web API standards that follow the current Web architecture. In particular, the recommendations as defined in the <<SDWBP,W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web>> as well as the <<DWBP,W3C best practices for sharing Data on the Web>>.

A detailed discussion of OGC Web Services and Web APIs can be found in the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-071.html#ug-evolution-from-web-services[OGC API Common Users Guide].

[[modular-API-introduction]]
=== Modular APIs

A goal of OGC API Standards is to provide rapid and easy access to spatial resources. To meet this goal, the needs of both the resource provider and the resource consumer must be considered. The approach specified in this standard is to provide a modular framework of API components. This framework provides a consistent "look and feel" across all OGC APIs. When API servers and clients are built from the same set of modules, the likelihood that they will integrate at run-time is greatly enhanced.

The modular Web API approach adopted by OGC API Standards has several facets:

* A common `core` that is recommended for all implementations of OGC API Standards. This OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core Standard defines this `core` in the <<rc_core-section,Core Requirements Class>>.
* Common descriptive resources which allow clients to learn the purpose and capabilities of an API as well as how they should be used. These resources are defined in the <<rc_landing-page-section,Landing Page Requirements Class>>.
* Clear separation between common requirements and more resource specific capabilities. The OGC API - Common Standard specifies the _common_ requirements that may be relevant to almost anyone who wants to build an API for spatial resources. Resource-specific requirements are addressed in resource-specific OGC Standards.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("conformance classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or API descriptions.
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs provide building blocks that can be reused in APIs in general. In other words, a server that implements the OGC API â€“ Features Standard should not be seen as a standalone service. Rather, this server should be viewed as a collection of API building blocks that together implement the capabilities that are specified in OGC API - Features. A corollary of this is that it should be possible to implement an API that simultaneously conforms to conformance classes from multiple current or future OGC API Standards.

[[using-api-introduction]]
=== Using APIs

OGC API Standards are expected to support two different approaches that clients may use when accessing an OGC conformant Web API.

In the first approach, clients are implemented with knowledge about the standard used to build the API and the associated resource types. The clients navigate the resources based on this knowledge and based on the responses provided by the API. The API definition may be used to determine details, e.g., on filter parameters, but this may not be necessary depending on the needs of the client. These are clients that are in general able to use multiple APIs as long as they implement OGC API Standards.

The other approach targets developers that are not familiar with OGC API Standards but want to interact with spatial data provided by an API that happens to implement OGC API Standards. In this case the developer will study and use the API definition - typically an OpenAPI document - to understand the API and implement the code to interact with that API. This assumes familiarity with the API definition language and the related tooling, but it should not be necessary to study the OGC API standards.
