== Scope

The OGC API-Common Part 1 Standard addresses Discovery operations directed against a Web API implementation. It identifies the hosted resources, defines conformance classes, and provides both human and machine readable documentation of the API design. The requirements specified in this standard should be applicable to any Web API implementation.

This standard defines a first stop for clients seeking to understand and use a new Web API. Use of this standard is strongly recommended for any new implementations of OGC Web API standards. However, in keeping with the OGC's principle of modular API standards, use of this standard is not required of OGC conformant Web API implementations.
