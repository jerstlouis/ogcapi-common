== Scope

The OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core Standard provides the fundamental rules for implementing a Web API that conforms to OGC API Standards. It seeks to establish a solid foundation which can be extended by other resource-specific Web API Standards.

First, this OGC Standard establishes rules for the use of HTTP protocols and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). These requirements seek to provide both API servers and clients a predictable environment for the exchange of HTTP requests and responses. These rules are applicable regardless of the resources being accessed.

This OGC Standard then enables discovery operations directed against a Web API implementation. It identifies the hosted resources, defines conformance classes, and provides both human and machine-readable documentation of the API design. The requirements specified in this standard SHOULD be applicable to any Web API implementation.
