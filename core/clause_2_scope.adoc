== Scope

This standard addresses Discovery operations directed against the API itself. It identifies the hosted resources, defines conformance classes, and provides both human and machine readable documentation of the API design. The requirements specified in this standard should be applicable to any Web API implementation.

This standard provides the first stop for clients seeking to understand and use a new Web API. Use of this standard is strongly recommended for and new implementation of OGC Web API standards. However, in keeping with the OGC's principle of modular API standards, use of this standard is not required of OGC conformant Web API implementations.
