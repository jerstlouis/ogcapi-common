== Security Considerations

The OAPI-Common Core Standard does not specify any specific security controls. However, it was constructed so that security controls can be added without impacting conformance.

See the Clause 11 <<rc_oas30-security,Security Section>> for a discussion of OpenAPI support for security controls.
